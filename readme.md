#Backend for rasp in esp

This repo is to run the backend of meticulous. 

For the correct functioning, you must create a ".env" file type and copy the following

    # PCB_VERSION = V3 # PCB with 2 ADS
    PCB_VERSION = V3.1 # PCB with 3 ADS

The sign **#** is for comments. The "V3" value refers to the FIKA PCB with two ADS and the V3.1 value refers to the FIKA PCB withs three ADS. 

The *read_serial.py* file is to read de data from the ESP.

The *back.py* file is to run the backend.
